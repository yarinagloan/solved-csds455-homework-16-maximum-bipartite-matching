<strong>Problem 1</strong>: Prove that you can reduce the <em>maximum bipartite matching </em>problem to the network flow problem. (Given a bipartite graph, turn it into a flow problem such that the value of the flow equals the maximum matching of the bipartite graph.)

<strong>Problem 2</strong>: Prove that you can reduce Menger’s Theorem to the network flow problem. (Given a graph, turn it into a flow problem so that the flow size gives the number of vertex disjoint paths of the graph.)

<strong>Problem 3</strong>: Suppose we have a network (directed graph) <em>D </em>with edge weights (capacities) and with source node <em>s </em>and sink node <em>t</em>. Let <em>S </em>⊂ <em>V </em>(<em>D</em>) and <em>T </em>⊂ <em>V </em>(<em>D</em>) be subsets of nodes such that <em>s </em>∈ <em>S,T </em>but <em>t /</em>∈ <em>S,T</em>. (<em>S,S</em>) is a <em>cut </em>of the network, and cap(<em>S,S</em>) is the sum of weights of edges with their tail in <em>S </em>and head in

<ol>

 <li><em>S</em>. Prove that cap(<em>S </em>∪ <em>T,S </em>∪ <em>T</em>) + cap(<em>S </em>∩ <em>T,S </em>∩ <em>T</em>) ≤ cap(<em>S,S</em>) + cap(<em>T,T</em>).</li>
